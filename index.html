				<h2>
					ESSEC Business School
				</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a student in first year of BBA at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School.</a>. I'm part of the english track, which means all my courses are dispensed in english. I am also part of the student life council, which is a decision-making assembly about what happens with associations, campus life... In parallel to that, we also manage how the funds given to the associations are used.

				<h2>
					Diving 
				</h2>
					<img src="images/plongee.jpg" alt="plongee" class="other">
					<p>
						I started diving 3 years ago, in Indonesia. I passed my first level in Corsica in 2019, but because of the covid, I have not been able to dive again since.

					Discovering different cultures
				</h2>

					<img src="images/newyork.jpg" alt="New York" class="cultures">
					<img src="images/cuba.jpg" alt="Cuba" class="cultures">
					<p>
						I had the chance to travel a little bit during my life, on few countries with very various cultures (Indonesia, USA, Cuba, Tunisia...) and I enjoyed it a lot ! Discovering different traditions, ways of life and habits allowed me to see diversity, and it helped me a lot when I entered ESSEC, since my track is very international, and you meet people from all across the world, the a culture choc is less strong when you already have seen other cultures.

						I enjoy singing whenever I got time to, I used to be part of a chorus ; I enjoy drawing and painting, especially with dilluable inks (you can follow me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/din_nayru_farore/?hl=fr" target="_blank">here</a> to see what I do); I saw sometimes too, I love fixing stuff and enhance them. Finally, I also like photography, especially the fact of succeeding in capturing the atmosphere of a moment, the state of mind of the people present, succeeding in bringing out their personality through a photo taken on the spot.
